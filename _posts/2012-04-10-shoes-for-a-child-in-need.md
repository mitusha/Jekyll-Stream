[TOMS](http://www.toms.com/), a company started by Blake Mycoskie in 2006, have a simple mission statement: One For One. With every pair purchased, TOMS will donate a pair of shoes to a child in need. It's a noble mission and I encourage you to support it, if you are not already.

In developing countries, shoes mean a great deal more than you might imagine.

Children will often walk miles for water, schooling and medical help. Without shoes, they are susceptible to [Hookworm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hookworm), [Podoconiosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podoconiosis), [Jiggers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chigoe_flea) and [Tetanus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetanus).

Next time you are looking for a pair of comfy canvas slip-ons, consider a pair of TOMS. I picked mine up over the weekend for just Â£19.
