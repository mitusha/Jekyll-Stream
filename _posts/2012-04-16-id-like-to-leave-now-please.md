summary: Taking account deactivation out of the remit of your users is idiotic.

A short time ago I installed an iPhone app called [Flixel](http://flixel.com/)&mdash;a photo app which lets you create simple [Cinemagraphs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinemagraph). I played around with it for an hour or two and while it's a good app it's not something I plan on using now or anytime in the future.

I've got a pretty strict policy when it comes to apps: If I'm not going to be using it frequently, I don't want it on my phone and I don't want it retaining my information. My value as an an app consumer is handing over my details and becoming a user. Once I am no longer a user, I am no longer of value and thus my information is useless to them&sup1;.

I clicked through to the Profile screen and looked for any instruction as to how I could deactivate my account but found nothing. While this isn't uncommon&mdash;neither Instagram nor Path let you deactivate your account within the app, making you do so from the website instead&mdash;it's a *huge* annoyance. Surely such an important action should be accessible from within the app?

I headed off to the Flixel website to look for a login option and found nothing. I sent a [tweet](https://twitter.com/#!/AdamWhitcroft/status/187505986670575616) asking how I can deactivate my account on April 4th and have yet to hear back, even though they are currently sending Â±4 tweets a day out.

Flixel isn't alone in this failing. I've battled with websites too. [Llustre.com](http://llustre.com/) have no way to deactivate your own account. I had to get in touch directly with their support team to request my details be removed. No matter how politely they handle the matter I will never be a returning customer and I will never give them anything other than a negative review.

I can not and will not accept these companies haven't considered people might, at some point, not want to be a part of their service anymore. It seems more plausible that a conscious decision was made to remove account deactivation from the remit of the user in the hopes the user will either not mind or not care. For this I pity them.

&sup1; <small>Not so long ago, the &ldquo;success&rdquo; of your product/service was more often than not measured by the number of registered users, regardless of their activity. The correlation between the success of a product/service and how many people use it is up for debate, but what is not is the distinction between active and idle users. Idle users are useless to you no matter what you may think because they offer nothing to you. You cannot interact with them, collect data on them or get them to help spread awareness of your product/service.</small>
