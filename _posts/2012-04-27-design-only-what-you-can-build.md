The nature of the tweet&mdash;stating this opinion as an absolute truth&mdash;may rub you the wrong way but the idea at it's core shouldn't.

It's a no-brainer that you should have an understanding of what you are designing for, and in the case of web design this understanding usually comes in the form of some development experience. Yes, you could feasibly design a website with no idea of how it would actually be built but odds are holes would quickly appear. Having even a modest amount of development experience helps you avoid basic pitfalls which will ultimately make the delivery process smoother for everyone involved.  When I'm designing a webpage, I do so with it's code and structure in mind; I'm planning ahead for reusable classes, symmetrical spacing and, where applicable, how an element would react should it's container change dimension.

I have a thorough understanding of HTML and CSS so this gives me the ability to design websites efficiently however I have zero understanding of Ruby, so does that mean I lack the ability to design a Twitter app? I have no knowledge of C,C++ or Objective C so does that mean I shouldn't design an iOS app until I could build it myself? 

I understand and largely agree with his sentiment, but defining the point at which I have enough understanding to effectively design something isn't quite so simple.
