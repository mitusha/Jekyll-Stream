title: Pixel fucking
summary: Taking a break from my normal design style with some Pixel Art in a series of Dribbble playoffs.

Over the past few evenings, I've been posting shots to my [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/AdamWhitcroft) page that break away from my usual, minimal design style. I tend to stick to minimal icon design, usually a single colour and one line weight because I love distilling something down to it's simplest, interpretable, form.

These icons, however, break away from my usual style. I've dabbled with pixel-art before but they generally don't make it out of a folder on my desktop.

##80s Television Set

Originally meant to be my rebound for the [Icon Battle #1](http://dribbble.com/shots/419355-NES-Icon-Battle-1) started by [Vic Bell](http://dribbble.com/vic_bell), but I was running out of time so rather than rush the remaining two elements (NES console and controller) I spent time polishing up the television set.

##Obi-Wan's Lightsaber

Part of the [Icon Battle #3](http://dribbble.com/shots/421834-Lightsaber-Icon-Battle-3) started by [Luke Jones](http://dribbble.com/lukejones). It was pretty tough to choose which Lightsaber to do as there are so many, but Obi-Wan's has always held a certain appeal to me so I went with that.

##Nintendo DSi

Without a doubt my favourite hand-held gadget. This was by far the most enjoyable to make. I had to bite the bullet and use some anti-aliasing for the A,B,X and Y buttons as I just couldn't get them to look half-decent without it.

Stepping out of my usual design preference has really given my creativity a boost, so I'm going to roll with it for as long as it's here.
