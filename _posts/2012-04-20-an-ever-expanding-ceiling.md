title: An ever expanding ceiling
summary: Here's hoping my relentless need to get better at what I do will culminate in a glorious beard.

I went into my first full-time web development role knowing absolutely nothing about HTML or CSS. The early few months were pretty much equal measures of frustration and joy. The frustration from having a problem to solve using tools I was unfamiliar with; the joy from the resolution of that problem. I quickly saw HTML and CSS as more than just simple tools to get a job done and from this a deeper appreciation grew. I started to take more care in their usage and construction, paying greater attention to things I hadn't cared about in the past like reusable classes, syntax and uniform formatting. Evenings were (and still are) spent trawling blogs the likes of [Harry Roberts](http://csswizardry.com/), [Chris Coyier](http://css-tricks.com/) and [Nicolas Gallagher](http://nicolasgallagher.com/).

I've been working with HTML and CSS for the better part of half a decade now and I think I've got a pretty solid handle on the two. This is not to say I know all there is to know about them&mdash;this would be ridiculous and utterly untrue due mostly to their ever evolving nature&mdash;but I've reached a juncture in my personal development where I can tackle just about anything put in my path pertaining to HTML and CSS with little to no incident and this isn't good enough anymore.

It's not in my nature to sit back and say &ldquo;that'll do&rdquo;. I need to evolve and I need to be challenged, and that challenge comes in the form of JavaScript.

For as long as I can remember, JavaScript has been somewhat of a White Whale and before working at 3seven9 I wasn't given any measure of exposure to it. I'm pretty lucky that I share a desk (well, near as dammit) with someone who loves sharing his incredible knowledge of JavaScript with me - the perfect nudge to set me on my new path. I've been spending a fair amount of my off-time on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) wading through their JavaScript courses and this has been an incredible new adventure so far.

I am about half way through their current course-load and that long-lost and all too intoxicating mixture of joy and frustration is back. I still find some of the concepts a little confusing, regularly mixing up objects with functions but I've yet to have anything but a great time with it.

JavaScript aside, I've been looking for decent learning material on Ruby which has led me to [Code School](http://www.codeschool.com/). Maybe, through learning Ruby, I'll finally be able to grow a beard. And it will be a justified beard, because I'll be a Ruby guy.

But for now, JavaScript.
