Climacons were born from an idea to design a sleek and simple weather app UI. Initially I only needed a cloud and sun icon, so I sat down and did some sketches. I wanted the icons to remain as simple as possible and only have a maximum of two line weightsâ€”a theme present in most of my icon design work. Within an evening or two I had 8 icons finished, which I posted on on [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/shots/536251-Weather-Icons) to a fantastic response, so I kept going. I wanted to see how far I could push the theme.

The [final result](http://adamwhitcroft.com/climacons/) went live last night following a few [teaser](http://dribbble.com/shots/540487-Climacons-teaser) [shots](http://dribbble.com/shots/540511-Climacons-teaser-2) and the final [annoucement shot](http://dribbble.com/shots/544084-Climacons) to an overwhelmingly positive reaction.

I'd like to take a moment to thank everyone who has liked or commented on the Climacons shots, those who have visited the website and especially those who have tweeted about it. It's a great feeling to see other people enjoying work you have put a lot of time and effort in to.

Thank you.

Now, [go and get those icons](http://adamwhitcroft.com/climacons/). If you like them, consider letting people know about them. I'd love to see them in action in an app, on a website or just a for-fun Dribbble shot. If you decide to post on Dribbble, all I ask is that you tag your shot with 'Climacons'. Enjoy.
