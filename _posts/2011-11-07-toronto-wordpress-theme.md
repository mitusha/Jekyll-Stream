I've learned a great deal from picking other websites apart—peering under the hood if you will. Static websites built with HTML and CSS< are easy to take apart and learn from. Wordpress themes are not as transparent.

Google Chrome makes it incredibly easy to view the HTML and CSS that make up a website and while this is enough with a static website, once a CMS comes in to play things aren't as easy. Browser developer tools lack the ability to show you the PHP responsible for generating what you see in your browser—this makes learning from inspection more difficult.

With this in mind, I've created a public GitHub repository containing my [Toronto theme](https://github.com/AdamWhitcroft/Toronto) for you to explore and dissect.

My hope is that you learn something you might not have known before and if not though, well, that's ok too.

<mark>As of 12.04.2012 I am no longer using the Toronto theme so there will be no further development but the repository will remain open and public.</mark>
