title: Pushing back on notifications
summary: I've disabled all of my social media email notifications. Life is better.

At the start of last week I made the decision to disable email notifications of any social interaction on Twitter, Dribbble and Instagram as I've found them to be increasingly distracting and invasive.

I'm not saying I've had enough of social media, but I'd like to be in control of when I choose to interact with and on these mediums. I love chatting to people over Twitter, leaving (or even better getting) a comment on Dribbble and checking out photos on Instagram but every time my phone blips I have to check it, almost regardless of where I am or what I'm doing. It's something I've always done so rather than trying to overcome this impulse, I've gone to the source of the blips: email notifications.

Dribbble was set to email me whenever:

* Someone comments on one my my shots
* Someone mentions me
* Someone follows me
* I receive invitations to invite new players
* Someone accepts my invitation and becomes a drafted player

Twitter would email me whenever:

* I'm sent a direct message
* I'm sent a reply or @ mentioned
* I'm followed by someone new
* My tweets are marked as favourite
* My tweets are retweeted

What about Instagram?

* Like notifications
* Comment notifications
* Contact notifications

That's a heck of a lot of emails being sent out, even if only a few of those conditions are triggered each day.

A week later I'm still alive, happy and managing to keep in touch with people on these platforms. The only difference is that I'm doing it when I feel like it, and not at the behest of my phone. If I take a little longer than usual to get back to you don't send out any search parties; chances are I just don't know about it yet.
