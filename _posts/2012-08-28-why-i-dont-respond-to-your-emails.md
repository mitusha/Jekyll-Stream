title: Why I don't respond to your emails
summary: I get a fair amount of email each week asking about my work availability, but I respond to less than half. Here's why&hellip;

I'd like to think I'm a fairly polite and friendly person, I make a concerted effort to read every email I get and I do my best to reply to as many as possible. That being said, I get my fair share of emails that have no hope of getting a reply; examples of which are outlined below.

##The Salutation
I often get emails that start like this:

> Adam,

How you greet me sets the tone for the rest of the email. Remember you are contacting me&mdash;usually out of the blue&mdash;to introduce yourself and whatever you may be wanting me to work on. The inclusion of something as simple as “Hi” or ‘Hello” makes a huge difference to me.

##The Pitch

You're getting in touch with me because you think I could add something of value to your project (which is awesome, thank you!).

> I was wondering if you'd like to create some icons for an iOS app we are planning to release?

Great, so I know you are after some icons and that's about it. What is the app for? Who are you aiming it at? Do you have a design aesthetic in mind or do I have carte blanche? How long do I have for these designs? You get the idea.

>I need some design work done, what is your day rate?

What work are you looking for? If this is going to be a longer term project a day rate isn't appropriate.

The more information you give me about the project the quicker I can, and will, reply. Include some information about yourself or your company too. I always research the company and the people before committing so this makes that step a little easier.

#The Closing

If you're emailing from a Hotmail or AOL address it's insta-delete. Sum up exactly what you are looking to get from me, what—if anything—you'd like to know about me and how you'd like to move forward. I prefer talking to people through Skype over email. A phone-call is even better.
