summary: My new website theme Toronto is responsive and content-oriented.

My problem with the site in it's previous form was that it was 'just enough'. I put only as much time and effort as was needed in order to get it live, both in terms of design and function. I didn't stop and think beforehand what it was, exactly, I wanted my site to say.

##Toronto

The Toronto Theme is something I'm really rather proud of. I wrote out a little list of things I wanted my new website to be, and at the top of that list where the words: "Simple &amp; Effective". I think I've achieved both with Toronto.

##Undesign

I've tried to shift the focus away from the design and onto the content. That isn't to say I put little time and effort into the design, quite the opposite in fact. From 3 initial design concepts I whittled away things I didn't think necessary—social media icons for example—and mixed elements until I was left with one solid and focused concept.

The goal of the new site is to be as lightweight and accessible as possible, while maintaining an aesthetic I can be proud of.

##Uniformity

Toronto has a common value of `1.5em` which has been applied to line-heights, margins, paddings and indents to create a uniform and balanced layout. Where a little more space is needed—between posts for example—mutiples of the common value have been used.

##Fluidity

Probably the biggest gripe with the previous design was it's fixed width. I love designing and building websites that can adapt to their display screen's size so the fact that my own website was fixed width—and therefore unable to do this—never sat right with me.

Toronto's content area has a maximum width of `680px` but when the screen width drops below this, the site—and it's images—will scale to match. I've included some generous gutters of `20px` to keep the content away from the edge of the screen. Below `320px` headings become a little smaller, as do line-heights and margins.
