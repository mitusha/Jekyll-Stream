A little earlier today [Mark Zuckerberg announced Instagram was to be acquired by Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10100318398827991) for $1bn.

The figure paid is ridiculous and the motive for the acquisition is a clear-cut case of buying-out one's competition.

This announcement, quite unsurprisingly, didn't go down without it's fair share of [criticism](https://twitter.com/#!/search/delete%20instagram) on Twitter.

Instagram, like just about every other app producer, are looking to make money. Granted this might not be their immediate goal&mdash;some companies might downplay or deny this all together&mdash;and they ways of getting there vary, but it will feature somewhere on their 3 year plan; a buy-out or selling advertising to it's users being the most common.

##Why do I care?

My concern with this acquisition is a simple one: my privacy. I don't know what Facebook plan to do with not only with my images, but the meta data associated with those images: where they were taken and who they were taken with. Will targeted ads be added to the app, tracking my usage, locations and followers all the while refining the ads served to me?

No indication there, and Instagram's terms of service aren't any more specific. However, given Facebook's history when it comes to user privacy, it's a safe bet my data will soon be a) on their system forever and b) in the hands of advertisers looking for ever more granular ad targeting.

If you are headed the way of many and would like to delete your Instagram account, but don't want to lose your photos, Mashable have compiled a [list of services](http://mashable.com/2012/04/09/deleting-instagram-account-save-pics/) that can help you out.

###Addendum

[Robert Scoble's response](http://www.quora.com/Facebook-Instagram-Acquisition-April-2012/What-was-it-about-Instagram-that-made-it-worth-a-1B-acquisition-by-Facebook) to "What was it about Instagram that made it worth a $1B acquisition by Facebook?" on Quora touches on some valid points as to why Facebook was willing to pay out so much.
