Bound in rough card with a cotton wrapped spine, the [The Manual](http://alwaysreadthemanual.com/) features bespoke illustrations and insightful commentary and takes a look not just at what we design, but why we design.

##Conception

The Manual is the brainchild of Andy McMillan, the founder of [Fiction](http://fiction.co/) and organiser of [Build](http://www.buildconf.com/), an annual week-long web design festival in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

The Manual came to life through a [Kickstarter Project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/goodonpaper/the-manual) started on February 10th 2011. The project needed to raise $40,000, which it did in just over 20 days time. 

Clearly this was going to be a success, right from the start.

##Presentation

I will openly admit I judge books by their cover and The Manual does not disappoint. The red cotton wrapped Smythe stitched spine, the 4mm thick binder's board cover and the bold black letterpress identity make a striking statement from the moment you pick it up. The raw cardboard edges are a welcome tactile change from the thin gloss card covers used on the vast majority of books today. I could imagine this book being made by hand in a little cabin, probably somewhere snowy, far far away.

The A5 130gsm uncoated [Munken Pure](http://www.roberthorne.co.uk/products/munken-pure/) paper stock feels luxurious, yet delicately rough. The litho print text combination&mdash;[Plantin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantin_(typeface)) for the body copy and [Lydian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydian_(typeface)) for the main headings&mdash;are a perfect match.

Each issue has a single highlight colour&mdash;in the cases of Issue #1 a warm Red (211,012,047)&mdash;used throughout; from the cotton wrapped spine to the only other colour allowed in the illustrations besides black and white.

There is no doubt an inordinate amount of time and care was taken in the conceptualisation, design and production of this book and that is immediately evident the second you see it, let alone pick it up.

##Substance

Each issue six authors are invited to share two pieces with you; a life changing lesson and a more substantial offering covering a topic of their choice&mdash;design related to varying degrees. In Issue #1 the authors are [Simon Collison](http://colly.com/), [Frank Chimero](http://frankchimero.com/), [Jon Tan](http://jontangerine.com/), [Dan Rubin](http://superfluousbanter.org/), [Liz Danzico](http://bobulate.com/) and [The Standardistas](http://webstandardistas.com/).

Each contributor's 'lesson' and 'substantial offering' are as different as the author who wrote them. Some chapters I enjoyed more than others. Overall, however, it was a thoroughly enjoyable read.

The book is a quick read; I got through it in the space of a few interrupted hours. I won't say that it's a game-changer, but I will say the passion and commitment the authors have to their craft is infectious. 

Web Design is maturing as an industry and this book is a reflection of that.

##Expectations

To be brutally honest I had no idea what to expect before ordering Issue #1. I had heard only positive things but I wasn't sure how much of that was due to the hype of the book rather than it's actual substance, it only took a couple of chapters to quieten these doubts.

It's a fantastic read, it looks and feels gorgeous and it's readily available so there is no chance of you missing out.

There is really no reason not to buy this, and the issues to follow.
