As conferences go, this features pretty hight up on my list of ones to attend because while it's about the web, it's not *all* about the web.

> A conference, hands-on workshops, a day of practical, an 
> evening of film, live music, evening lectures, a craft 
> beer festival, a pub quiz, a pop-up shop, markets, 
> exhibitions, meetups and parties.

> Build is back, baby.
> <small>Build 2012 introduction</small>

While it goes without saying the speakers are a big pull, I'm more interested in the hands-on stuff. I haven't a clue how to sharpen an axe, brand leather, temper chocolate or brew the perfect coffee; things I feel I should know. Were I able to attend the planned Workshops which, conveniently, cover these very topics, I could head into the woods feeling that much more prepared&sup1;.

Then there is the week long film, music and practical festival.

Then there are the Fringe events, one of which is all about craft beer. I love beer.

Tickets to the public went on sale at 4pm yesterday, and by just after 5pm they were sold out.

The website was designed by [Kyle Meyer](http://blog.kylemeyer.com/) who also designed the websites for [The Manual](http://alwaysreadthemanual.com/) and [8 Faces](http://8faces.com/). [Tim Boelaars](http://twitter.com/#!/timboelaars) was commissioned to do what he does best and the [icons he designed](http://timboelaars.nl/build-conference) are nothing short of awesome.

I'll be at Build 2013.
